date: "2016-08-27"
description: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in jQuery UI before 1.12.0 might
  allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the closeText
  parameter of the dialog function. It was found that a parameter of the dialog box
  feature of jQuery UI was vulnerable to cross site scripting. An attacker could use
  this flaw to execute a malicious script via the dialog box when it was displayed
  to a user.
