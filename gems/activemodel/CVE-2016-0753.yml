title: 'CVE-2016-0753 rubygem-activemodel, rubygem-activerecord: possible input validation
  circumvention in Active Model'
date: "2016-01-25"
description: Active Model in Ruby on Rails 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1,
  and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 supports the use of instance-level writers for class
  accessors, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via
  crafted parameters. A flaw was found in the way the Active Model based models processed
  attributes. An attacker with the ability to pass arbitrary attributes to models
  could possibly use this flaw to bypass input validation.
