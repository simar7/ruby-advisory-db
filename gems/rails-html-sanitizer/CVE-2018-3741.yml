title: 'CVE-2018-3741 rubygem-rails-html-sanitizer: non-whitelisted attributes are
  present in sanitized output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments leading
  to XSS vulnerability'
date: "2018-03-22"
description: There is a possible XSS vulnerability in all rails-html-sanitizer gem
  versions below 1.0.4 for Ruby. The gem allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present
  in sanitized output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these
  attributes can lead to an XSS attack on target applications. This issue is similar
  to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah. All users running an affected release should either
  upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
