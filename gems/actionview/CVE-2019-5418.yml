title: 'CVE-2019-5418 rubygem-actionpack: render file directory traversal in Action
  View'
date: "2019-03-13"
description: There is a File Content Disclosure vulnerability in Action View <5.2.2.1,
  <5.1.6.2, <5.0.7.2, <4.2.11.1 and v3 where specially crafted accept headers can
  cause contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem to be exposed.
  A content disclosure flaw was found in rubygem-actionview. Specially crafted accept
  headers, in combination with calls to 'render file:', can cause arbitrary files
  on the target server to be rendered, disclosing the file contents. Code execution
  cannot be ruled out if the attacker is able to gain access to the proper files.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity
  as well as system availability.
