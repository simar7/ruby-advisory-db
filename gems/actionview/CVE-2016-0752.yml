title: 'CVE-2016-0752 rubygem-actionview, rubygem-actionpack: directory traversal
  flaw in Action View'
date: "2016-01-25"
description: Directory traversal vulnerability in Action View in Ruby on Rails before
  3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before
  5.0.0.beta1.1 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files by leveraging an application's
  unrestricted use of the render method and providing a .. (dot dot) in a pathname.
  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Action View component searched
  for templates for rendering. If an application passed untrusted input to the 'render'
  method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to render unexpected
  files and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
