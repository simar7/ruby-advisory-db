title: 'CVE-2015-7577 rubygem-activerecord: Nested attributes rejection proc bypass
  in Active Record'
date: "2016-01-25"
description: activerecord/lib/active_record/nested_attributes.rb in Active Record
  in Ruby on Rails 3.1.x and 3.2.x before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1,
  4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not properly implement a
  certain destroy option, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended change
  restrictions by leveraging use of the nested attributes feature. A flaw was found
  in the Active Record component's handling of nested attributes in combination with
  the destroy flag. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to set attributes to
  invalid values or clear all attributes.
