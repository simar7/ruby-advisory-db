title: 'CVE-2016-6317 rubygem-activerecord: unsafe query generation in Active Record'
date: "2016-08-11"
description: Action Record in Ruby on Rails 4.2.x before 4.2.7.1 does not properly
  consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and
  the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query
  restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted
  request, as demonstrated by certain "[nil]" values, a related issue to CVE-2012-2660,
  CVE-2012-2694, and CVE-2013-0155. A flaw was found in the way Active Record handled
  certain special values in dynamic finders and relations. If a Ruby on Rails application
  performed JSON parameter parsing, a remote attacker could possibly manipulate search
  conditions in SQL queries generated by the application.
