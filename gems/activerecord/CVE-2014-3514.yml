title: 'CVE-2014-3514 rubygem-activerecord: Strong Parameter bypass with create_with'
date: "2014-08-18"
description: activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/query_methods.rb in Active Record
  in Ruby on Rails 4.0.x before 4.0.9 and 4.1.x before 4.1.5 allows remote attackers
  to bypass the strong parameters protection mechanism via crafted input to an application
  that makes create_with calls. It was discovered that Active Record's create_with
  method failed to properly check attributes passed to it. A remote attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to bypass the strong parameter protection and modify arbitrary
  model attributes via mass assignment if an application using Active Record called
  create_with with untrusted values.
