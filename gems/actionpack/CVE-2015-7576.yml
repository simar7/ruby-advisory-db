title: 'CVE-2015-7576 rubygem-actionpack: Timing attack vulnerability in basic authentication
  in Action Controller'
date: "2016-01-25"
description: The http_basic_authenticate_with method in actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/http_authentication.rb
  in the Basic Authentication implementation in Action Controller in Ruby on Rails
  before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x
  before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not use a constant-time algorithm for verifying credentials,
  which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication by measuring
  timing differences. A flaw was found in the way the Action Controller component
  compared user names and passwords when performing HTTP basic authentication. Time
  taken to compare strings could differ depending on input, possibly allowing a remote
  attacker to determine valid user names and passwords using a timing attack.
