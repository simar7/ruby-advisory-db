title: 'CVE-2016-2098 rubygem-actionview, rubygem-actionpack: code injection vulnerability
  in Action View'
date: "2016-02-29"
description: Action Pack in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.22.2, 4.x before 4.1.14.2, and
  4.2.x before 4.2.5.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Ruby code by leveraging
  an application's unrestricted use of the render method. A code injection flaw was
  found in the way Action View component searched for templates for rendering. If
  an application passed untrusted input to the 'render' method, a remote, unauthenticated
  attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code.
