title: 'CVE-2016-2097 rubygem-actionview, rubygem-actionpack: directory traversal
  in Action View, incomplete CVE-2016-0752 fix'
date: "2016-02-29"
description: 'Directory traversal vulnerability in Action View in Ruby on Rails before
  3.2.22.2 and 4.x before 4.1.14.2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files
  by leveraging an application''s unrestricted use of the render method and providing
  a .. (dot dot) in a pathname.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
  fix for CVE-2016-0752. A directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Action
  View component searched for templates for rendering. If an application passed untrusted
  input to the ''render'' method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this
  flaw to render unexpected files and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.'
