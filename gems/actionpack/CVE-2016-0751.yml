title: 'CVE-2016-0751 rubygem-actionpack: possible object leak and denial of service
  attack in Action Pack'
date: "2016-01-25"
description: actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/mime_type.rb in Action Pack in Ruby
  on Rails before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1,
  and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not properly restrict use of the MIME type cache,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
  via a crafted HTTP Accept header. A flaw was found in the way the Action Pack component
  performed MIME type lookups. Since queries were cached in a global cache of MIME
  types, an attacker could use this flaw to grow the cache indefinitely, potentially
  resulting in a denial of service.
