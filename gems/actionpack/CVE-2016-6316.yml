title: 'CVE-2016-6316 rubygem-actionview: cross-site scripting flaw in Action View'
date: "2016-08-11"
description: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Action View in Ruby on Rails
  3.x before 3.2.22.3, 4.x before 4.2.7.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.1 might allow remote
  attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via text declared as "HTML safe"
  and used as attribute values in tag handlers. It was discovered that Action View
  tag helpers did not escape quotes when using strings declared as HTML safe as attribute
  values. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack.
