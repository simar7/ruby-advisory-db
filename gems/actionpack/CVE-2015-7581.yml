title: 'CVE-2015-7581 rubygem-actionpack: Object leak vulnerability for wildcard controller
  routes in Action Pack'
date: "2016-01-25"
description: actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/route_set.rb in Action Pack in
  Ruby on Rails 4.x before 4.2.5.1 and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (superfluous caching and memory consumption) by leveraging
  an application's use of a wildcard controller route. A flaw was found in the Action
  Pack component's caching of controller references. An attacker could use this flaw
  to cause unbounded memory growth, potentially resulting in a denial of service.
