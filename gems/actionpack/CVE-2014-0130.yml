title: 'CVE-2014-0130 rubygem-actionpack: directory traversal issue'
date: "2014-05-06"
description: Directory traversal vulnerability in actionpack/lib/abstract_controller/base.rb
  in the implicit-render implementation in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.18, 4.0.x before
  4.0.5, and 4.1.x before 4.1.1, when certain route globbing configurations are enabled,
  allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a crafted request. A directory
  traversal flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled wildcard segments in routes
  with implicit rendering. A remote attacker could use this flaw to retrieve arbitrary
  local files accessible to a Ruby on Rails application using the aforementioned routes
  via a specially crafted request.
