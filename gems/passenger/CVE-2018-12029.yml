title: 'CVE-2018-12029 passenger: CHMOD race condition in nginx_module/ngx_http_passenger_module.c
  allows for local privilege escalation'
date: "2018-06-12"
description: A race condition in the nginx module in Phusion Passenger 3.x through
  5.x before 5.3.2 allows local escalation of privileges when a non-standard passenger_instance_registry_dir
  with insufficiently strict permissions is configured. Replacing a file with a symlink
  after the file was created, but before it was chowned, leads to the target of the
  link being chowned via the path. Targeting sensitive files such as root's crontab
  file allows privilege escalation.
