title: 'CVE-2015-7519 passenger: Header overwriting issue allowing user impersonation'
date: "2015-11-23"
description: agent/Core/Controller/SendRequest.cpp in Phusion Passenger before 4.0.60
  and 5.0.x before 5.0.22, when used in Apache integration mode or in standalone mode
  without a filtering proxy, allows remote attackers to spoof headers passed to applications
  by using an _ (underscore) character instead of a - (dash) character in an HTTP
  header, as demonstrated by an X_User header.
patched_versions:
- ~> 4.0.60
- '>= 5.0.22'
