title: 'CVE-2016-3693 foreman: inspect in a provisioning template exposes sensitive
  controller information'
date: "2016-04-20"
description: The Safemode gem before 1.2.4 for Ruby, when initialized with a delegate
  object that is a Rails controller, allows context-dependent attackers to obtain
  sensitive information via the inspect method. A flaw was found in the provisioning
  template handling in foreman. An attacker, with permissions to create templates,
  can cause internal Rails information to be displayed when it is processed, resulting
  in potentially sensitive information being disclosed.
