title: 'CVE-2018-1000544 rubyzip: arbitrary file write vulnerability / arbitrary code
  execution using a specially crafted zip file'
date: "2018-06-14"
description: rubyzip gem rubyzip version 1.2.1 and earlier contains a Directory Traversal
  vulnerability in Zip::File component that can result in write arbitrary files to
  the filesystem. This attack appear to be exploitable via If a site allows uploading
  of .zip files , an attacker can upload a malicious file that contains symlinks or
  files with absolute pathnames "../" to write arbitrary files to the filesystem..
  A directory and symbolic link traversal flaw was found in the way rubyzip gem extracts
  zip files. An attacker, with access to a privileged application capable of extracting
  zip files, could use this flaw to write new files to arbitrary paths, accessible
  by the aforementioned privileged application.
