title: 'CVE-2019-16892 cfme: rubygem-rubyzip denial of service via crafted ZIP file'
date: "2019-09-12"
description: In Rubyzip before 1.3.0, a crafted ZIP file can bypass application checks
  on ZIP entry sizes because data about the uncompressed size can be spoofed. This
  allows attackers to cause a denial of service (disk consumption). A vulnerability
  in Rubyzip, versions prior to 1.3.0, allows a crafted ZIP file to bypass application
  checks on ZIP entry sizes. This allows an attacker to spoof data regarding the uncompressed
  size of the ZIP file, causing a denial of service due to disk consumption. Availability
  of the system is the highest threat.
patched_versions:
- '>= 1.3.0'
