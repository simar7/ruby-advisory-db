title: 'CVE-2020-10663 rubygem-json: Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability in JSON'
date: "2020-03-19"
description: The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9,
  2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability.
  This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection
  behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation
  of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.
