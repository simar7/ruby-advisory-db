title: 'CVE-2015-7499 libxml2: Heap-based buffer overflow in xmlGROW'
date: "2016-01-19"
description: Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlGROW function in parser.c in libxml2
  before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive process memory
  information via unspecified vectors. A denial of service flaw was found in libxml2.
  A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when
  processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to leak
  potentially sensitive information.
