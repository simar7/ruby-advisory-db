title: 'CVE-2016-4658 libxml2: Use after free via namespace node in XPointer ranges'
date: "2017-03-11"
description: xpointer.c in libxml2 before 2.9.5 (as used in Apple iOS before 10, OS
  X before 10.12, tvOS before 10, and watchOS before 3, and other products) does not
  forbid namespace nodes in XPointer ranges, which allows remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and memory corruption)
  via a crafted XML document.
