title: 'CVE-2015-1819 libxml2: denial of service processing a crafted XML document'
date: "2015-04-14"
description: The xmlreader in libxml allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (memory consumption) via crafted XML data, related to an XML Entity Expansion
  (XEE) attack. A denial of service flaw was found in the way the libxml2 library
  parsed certain XML files. An attacker could provide a specially crafted XML file
  that, when parsed by an application using libxml2, could cause that application
  to use an excessive amount of memory.
