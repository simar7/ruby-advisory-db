title: 'CVE-2017-5029 chromium-browser: integer overflow in libxslt'
date: "2017-05-09"
description: The xsltAddTextString function in transform.c in libxslt 1.1.29, as used
  in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 57.0.2987.98 for Mac, Windows, and Linux and
  57.0.2987.108 for Android, lacked a check for integer overflow during a size calculation,
  which allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted
  HTML page.
