title: 'CVE-2019-11068 libxslt: xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite routines security
  bypass by crafted URL'
date: "2019-04-22"
description: libxslt through 1.1.33 allows bypass of a protection mechanism because
  callers of xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite permit access even upon receiving a
  -1 error code. xsltCheckRead can return -1 for a crafted URL that is not actually
  invalid and is subsequently loaded.
