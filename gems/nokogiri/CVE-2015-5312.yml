title: 'CVE-2015-5312 libxml2: CPU exhaustion when processing specially crafted XML
  input'
date: "2015-12-15"
description: The xmlStringLenDecodeEntities function in parser.c in libxml2 before
  2.9.3 does not properly prevent entity expansion, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted XML data, a
  different vulnerability than CVE-2014-3660. A denial of service flaw was found in
  libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that,
  when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to
  use an excessive amount of CPU.
