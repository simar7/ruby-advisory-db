title: 'CVE-2020-5249 rubygem-puma: attacker is able to use carriage return character
  to insert malicious content (HTTP Response Splitting), this could lead to XSS'
date: "2020-03-03"
description: In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.3 and 3.12.4, if an application using Puma
  allows untrusted input in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage
  return character to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional
  headers or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response
  Splitting. While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several
  other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2020-5247,
  which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses. This has been fixed
  in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4. A flaw was discovered in rubygem-puma, where it did not properly
  forbid untrusted input in an early-hints header. This flaw allows an attacker with
  the ability to tamper with HTTP headers to insert a carriage return character to
  end the header and then insert malicious content, allowing an HTTP response splitting,
  which exposes the risk of attacks such as cross-site scripting.
