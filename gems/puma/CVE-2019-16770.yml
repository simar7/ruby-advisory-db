title: 'CVE-2019-16770 rubygem-puma: keepalive requests from poorly-behaved client
  leads to denial of service'
date: "2019-12-05"
description: In Puma before versions 3.12.2 and 4.3.1, a poorly-behaved client could
  use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service
  attack. If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads
  available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests
  frequently enough. This vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.
