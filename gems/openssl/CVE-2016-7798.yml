title: 'CVE-2016-7798 ruby: IV Reuse in GCM Mode'
date: "2017-10-24"
description: The openssl gem for Ruby uses the same initialization vector (IV) in
  GCM Mode (aes-*-gcm) when the IV is set before the key, which makes it easier for
  context-dependent attackers to bypass the encryption protection mechanism.
