title: 'CVE-2020-7663 rubygem-websocket-extensions: ReDoS vulnerability in Sec-WebSocket-Extensions
  parser'
date: "2020-06-05"
description: websocket-extensions ruby module prior to 0.1.5 allows Denial of Service
  (DoS) via Regex Backtracking. The extension parser may take quadratic time when
  parsing a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is
  a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other character. This could
  be abused by an attacker to conduct Regex Denial Of Service (ReDoS) on a single-threaded
  server by providing a malicious payload with the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header.
  A flaw was found in the websocket-extensions ruby module in versions prior to 0.1.5.
  The parser may take quadratic time when parsing a header containing an unclosed
  string parameter value whose content is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash
  and another character. When abused by an attacker, a Regex denial of service on
  a single-threaded server could occur. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to system availability.
