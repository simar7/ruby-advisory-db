title: 'CVE-2015-4020 rubygems: incomplete fix for CVE-2015-3900'
date: "2015-06-08"
description: 'RubyGems 2.0.x before 2.0.17, 2.2.x before 2.2.5, and 2.4.x before 2.4.8
  does not validate the hostname when fetching gems or making API requests, which
  allows remote attackers to redirect requests to arbitrary domains via a crafted
  DNS SRV record with a domain that is suffixed with the original domain name, aka
  a "DNS hijack attack." NOTE: this vulnerability exists because to an incomplete
  fix for CVE-2015-3900. A flaw was found in a way rubygems verified the API endpoint
  hostname retrieved through a DNS SRV record. A man-in-the-middle attacker could
  use this flaw to force a client to download content from an untrusted domain.'
