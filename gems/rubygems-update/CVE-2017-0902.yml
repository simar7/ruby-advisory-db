title: 'CVE-2017-0902 rubygems: DNS hijacking vulnerability'
date: "2017-08-29"
description: RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier is vulnerable to a DNS hijacking
  vulnerability that allows a MITM attacker to force the RubyGems client to download
  and install gems from a server that the attacker controls. A vulnerability was found
  where rubygems did not sanitize DNS responses when requesting the hostname of the
  rubygems server for a domain, via a _rubygems._tcp DNS SRV query. An attacker with
  the ability to manipulate DNS responses could direct the gem command towards a different
  domain.
