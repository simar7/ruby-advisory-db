title: 'CVE-2019-8324 rubygems: Installing a malicious gem may lead to arbitrary code
  execution'
date: "2019-03-05"
description: An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. A crafted
  gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker could
  inject arbitrary code to the stub line of gemspec, which is eval-ed by code in ensure_loadable_spec
  during the preinstall check. A flaw was found in RubyGems. A crafted gem with a
  multi-line name is not handled correctly allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary
  code to the stub line of gemspec. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
  to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
