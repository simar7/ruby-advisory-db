title: 'CVE-2017-0899 rubygems: Escape sequence in the "summary" field of gemspec'
date: "2017-08-29"
description: RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier is vulnerable to maliciously crafted
  gem specifications that include terminal escape characters. Printing the gem specification
  would execute terminal escape sequences. A vulnerability was found where rubygems
  did not properly sanitize gems' specification text. A specially crafted gem could
  interact with the terminal via the use of escape sequences.
