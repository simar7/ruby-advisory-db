title: 'CVE-2017-0901 rubygems: Arbitrary file overwrite due to incorrect validation
  of specification name'
date: "2017-08-29"
description: RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier fails to validate specification names,
  allowing a maliciously crafted gem to potentially overwrite any file on the filesystem.
  It was found that rubygems did not sanitize gem names during installation of a given
  gem. A specially crafted gem could use this flaw to install files outside of the
  regular directory.
