title: 'CVE-2017-0903 rubygems: Unsafe object deserialization through YAML formatted
  gem specifications'
date: "2017-10-09"
description: RubyGems versions between 2.0.0 and 2.6.13 are vulnerable to a possible
  remote code execution vulnerability. YAML deserialization of gem specifications
  can bypass class white lists. Specially crafted serialized objects can possibly
  be used to escalate to remote code execution. A vulnerability was found where the
  rubygems module was vulnerable to an unsafe YAML deserialization when inspecting
  a gem. Applications inspecting gem files without installing them can be tricked
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the ruby interpreter.
