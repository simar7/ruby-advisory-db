title: 'CVE-2011-5036 rubygem-rack: hash table collisions DoS (oCERT-2011-003)'
date: "2011-12-28"
description: Rack before 1.1.3, 1.2.x before 1.2.5, and 1.3.x before 1.3.6 computes
  hash values for form parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash
  collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters.
