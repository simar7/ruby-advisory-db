title: 'CVE-2015-3225 rubygem-rack: Potential Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack
  normalize_params()'
date: "2015-06-16"
description: lib/rack/utils.rb in Rack before 1.5.4 and 1.6.x before 1.6.2, as used
  with Ruby on Rails 3.x and 4.x and other products, allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (SystemStackError) via a request with a large parameter depth.
  A flaw was found in a way Rack processed parameters of incoming requests. An attacker
  could use this flaw to send a crafted request that would cause an application using
  Rack to crash.
patched_versions:
- '>= 1.6.2'
