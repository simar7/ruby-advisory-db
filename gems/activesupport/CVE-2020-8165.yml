title: 'CVE-2020-8165 rubygem-activesupport: potentially unintended unmarshalling
  of user-provided objects in MemCacheStore and RedisCacheStore'
date: "2020-05-18"
description: 'A deserialization of untrusted data vulnernerability exists in rails
  < 5.2.4.3, rails < 6.0.3.1 that can allow an attacker to unmarshal user-provided
  objects in MemCacheStore and RedisCacheStore potentially resulting in an RCE. A
  flaw was found in rubygem-activesupport. An untrusted user input can be written
  to the cache store using the `raw: true` parameter which can lead to the result
  being evaluated as a marshaled object instead of plain text. The threat from this
  vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.'
