title: 'CVE-2019-11358 js-jquery: prototype pollution in object''s prototype leading
  to denial of service or remote code execution or property injection'
date: "2019-04-19"
description: jQuery before 3.4.0, as used in Drupal, Backdrop CMS, and other products,
  mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of Object.prototype pollution. If
  an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable __proto__ property, it could
  extend the native Object.prototype. A Prototype Pollution vulnerability was found
  in jquery. Untrusted JSON passed to the `extend` function could lead to modifying
  objects up the prototype chain, including the global Object. A crafted JSON object
  passed to a vulnerable method could lead to denial of service or data injection,
  with various consequences.
