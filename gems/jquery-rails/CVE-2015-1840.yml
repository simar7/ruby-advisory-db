title: 'CVE-2015-1840 rubygem-jquery-rails: CSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails'
date: "2015-06-16"
description: jquery_ujs.js in jquery-rails before 3.1.3 and 4.x before 4.0.4 and rails.js
  in jquery-ujs before 1.0.4, as used with Ruby on Rails 3.x and 4.x, allow remote
  attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy, and trigger transmission of a CSRF token
  to a different-domain web server, via a leading space character in a URL within
  an attribute value. A flaw was found in the way rubygem-jquery-rails filtered CSRF
  tokens from HTTP requests. An attacker able to control the href attribute of an
  anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag, could use this flaw to force an
  application to send a request that includes a CSRF token to an attacker-specified
  site, thus leaking the CSRF token.
