description: The DNS protocol, as implemented in (1) BIND 8 and 9 before 9.5.0-P1,
  9.4.2-P1, and 9.3.5-P1; (2) Microsoft DNS in Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and
  Server 2003 SP1 and SP2; and other implementations allow remote attackers to spoof

  poisoning against recursive resolvers, related to insufficient randomness of DNS
  transaction IDs and source ports, aka "DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability"
  or "the Kaminsky bug."
