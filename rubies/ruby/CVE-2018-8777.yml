title: 'CVE-2018-8777 ruby: DoS by large request in WEBrick'
date: "2018-03-28"
description: In Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x
  before 2.5.1, and 2.6.0-preview1, an attacker can pass a large HTTP request with
  a crafted header to WEBrick server or a crafted body to WEBrick server/handler and
  cause a denial of service (memory consumption). It was found that WEBrick could
  be forced to use an excessive amount of memory during the processing of HTTP requests,
  leading to a Denial of Service. An attacker could use this flaw to send huge requests
  to a WEBrick application, resulting in the server running out of memory.
