title: 'CVE-2015-9096 ruby: SMTP command injection via CRLF sequences in RCPT TO or
  MAIL FROM commands in Net::SMTP'
date: "2015-12-09"
description: Net::SMTP in Ruby before 2.4.0 is vulnerable to SMTP command injection
  via CRLF sequences in a RCPT TO or MAIL FROM command, as demonstrated by CRLF sequences
  immediately before and after a DATA substring. A SMTP command injection flaw was
  found in the way Ruby's Net::SMTP module handled CRLF sequences in certain SMTP
  commands. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to inject SMTP commands in
  a SMTP session in order to facilitate phishing attacks or spam campaigns.
patched_versions:
- '>= 2.4.0'
