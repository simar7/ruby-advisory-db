title: 'CVE-2019-16254 ruby: HTTP response splitting in WEBrick (Additional fix)'
date: "2019-10-01"
description: 'Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows
  HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into
  the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to
  split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue
  exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF
  vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.'
