title: 'CVE-2017-14033 ruby: Buffer underrun in OpenSSL ASN1 decode'
date: "2017-09-14"
description: The decode method in the OpenSSL::ASN1 module in Ruby before 2.2.8, 2.3.x
  before 2.3.5, and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service
  (interpreter crash) via a crafted string. It was found that the decode method of
  the OpenSSL::ASN1 module was vulnerable to buffer underrun. An attacker could pass
  a specially crafted string to the application in order to crash the ruby interpreter,
  causing a denial of service.
patched_versions:
- ~> 2.2.8
- ~> 2.3.5
- '>= 2.4.2'
