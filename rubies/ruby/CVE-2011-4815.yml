title: 'CVE-2011-4815 ruby: hash table collisions CPU usage DoS (oCERT-2011-003)'
date: "2011-12-28"
description: Ruby (aka CRuby) before 1.8.7-p357 computes hash values without restricting
  the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an
  application that maintains a hash table.
