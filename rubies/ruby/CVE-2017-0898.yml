title: 'CVE-2017-0898 ruby: Buffer underrun vulnerability in Kernel.sprintf'
date: "2017-09-14"
description: Ruby before 2.4.2, 2.3.5, and 2.2.8 is vulnerable to a malicious format
  string which contains a precious specifier (*) with a huge minus value. Such situation
  can lead to a buffer overrun, resulting in a heap memory corruption or an information
  disclosure from the heap. A buffer underflow was found in ruby's sprintf function.
  An attacker, with ability to control its format string parameter, could send a specially
  crafted string that would disclose heap memory or crash the interpreter.
patched_versions:
- ~> 2.2.8
- ~> 2.3.5
- '>= 2.4.2'
