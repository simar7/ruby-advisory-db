title: 'CVE-2018-8778 ruby: Buffer under-read in String#unpack'
date: "2018-03-28"
description: In Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x
  before 2.5.1, and 2.6.0-preview1, an attacker controlling the unpacking format (similar
  to format string vulnerabilities) can trigger a buffer under-read in the String#unpack
  method, resulting in a massive and controlled information disclosure. A integer
  underflow was found in the way String#unpack decodes the unpacking format. An attacker,
  able to control the unpack format, could use this flaw to disclose arbitrary parts
  of the application's memory.
