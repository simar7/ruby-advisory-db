title: 'CVE-2018-6914 ruby: Unintentional file and directory creation with directory
  traversal in tempfile and tmpdir'
date: "2018-03-28"
description: Directory traversal vulnerability in the Dir.mktmpdir method in the tmpdir
  library in Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x before
  2.5.1, and 2.6.0-preview1 might allow attackers to create arbitrary directories
  or files via a .. (dot dot) in the prefix argument. It was found that the tmpdir
  and tempfile modules did not sanitize their file name argument. An attacker with
  control over the name could create temporary files and directories outside of the
  dedicated directory.
