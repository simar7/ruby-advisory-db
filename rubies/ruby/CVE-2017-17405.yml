title: 'CVE-2017-17405 ruby: Command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP'
date: "2017-12-14"
description: Ruby before 2.4.3 allows Net::FTP command injection. Net::FTP#get, getbinaryfile,
  gettextfile, put, putbinaryfile, and puttextfile use Kernel#open to open a local
  file. If the localfile argument starts with the "|" pipe character, the command
  following the pipe character is executed. The default value of localfile is File.basename(remotefile),
  so malicious FTP servers could cause arbitrary command execution. It was discovered
  that the Net::FTP module did not properly process filenames in combination with
  certain operations. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary
  commands by setting up a malicious FTP server and tricking a user or Ruby application
  into downloading files with specially crafted names using the Net::FTP module.
