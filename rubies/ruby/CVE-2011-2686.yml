title: 'CVE-2011-2686 CVE-2011-2705 CVE-2011-3009 ruby: Properly initialize the random
  number generator when forking new process'
date: "2011-07-02"
description: 'Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking,
  which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of random
  numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a different child
  process, a related issue to CVE-2003-0900.  NOTE: this issue exists because of a
  regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.'
