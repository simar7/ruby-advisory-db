title: 'CVE-2017-17742 ruby: HTTP response splitting in WEBrick'
date: "2018-03-28"
description: Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x before
  2.5.1, and 2.6.0-preview1 allows an HTTP Response Splitting attack. An attacker
  can inject a crafted key and value into an HTTP response for the HTTP server of
  WEBrick. It was found that WEBrick did not sanitize headers sent back to clients,
  resulting in a response-splitting vulnerability. An attacker, able to control the
  server's headers, could force WEBrick into injecting additional headers to a client.
