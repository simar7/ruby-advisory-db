title: 'CVE-2017-10784 ruby: Escape sequence injection vulnerability in the Basic
  authentication of WEBrick'
date: "2017-09-14"
description: The Basic authentication code in WEBrick library in Ruby before 2.2.8,
  2.3.x before 2.3.5, and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 allows remote attackers to inject terminal
  emulator escape sequences into its log and possibly execute arbitrary commands via
  a crafted user name. It was found that WEBrick did not sanitize all its log messages.
  If logs were printed in a terminal, an attacker could interact with the terminal
  via the use of escape sequences.
patched_versions:
- ~> 2.2.8
- ~> 2.3.5
- '>= 2.4.2'
