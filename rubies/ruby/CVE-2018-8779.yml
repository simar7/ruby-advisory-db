title: 'CVE-2018-8779 ruby: Unintentional socket creation by poisoned NULL byte in
  UNIXServer and UNIXSocket'
date: "2018-03-28"
description: In Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x
  before 2.5.1, and 2.6.0-preview1, the UNIXServer.open and UNIXSocket.open methods
  are not checked for null characters. It may be connected to an unintended socket.
  It was found that the UNIXSocket::open and UNIXServer::open ruby methods did not
  handle the NULL byte properly. An attacker, able to inject NULL bytes in the socket
  path, could possibly trigger an unspecified behavior of the ruby script.
patched_versions:
- ~> 2.2.10
- ~> 2.3.7
- ~> 2.4.4
- ~> 2.5.1
- '> 2.6.0-preview1'
