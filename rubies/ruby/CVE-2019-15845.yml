title: 'CVE-2019-15845 ruby: NUL injection vulnerability of File.fnmatch and File.fnmatch?'
date: "2019-10-01"
description: Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 mishandles
  path checking within File.fnmatch functions. A flaw was discovered in Ruby in the
  way certain functions handled strings containing NULL bytes. Specifically, the built-in
  methods File.fnmatch and its alias File.fnmatch? did not properly handle path patterns
  containing the NULL byte. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to make a Ruby
  script access unexpected files and to bypass intended file system access restrictions.
