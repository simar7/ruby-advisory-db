title: 'CVE-2012-5371 ruby: Murmur hash-flooding DoS flaw in ruby 1.9 (oCERT-2012-001)'
date: "2012-11-23"
description: Ruby (aka CRuby) 1.9 before 1.9.3-p327 and 2.0 before r37575 computes
  hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions
  predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
  (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table,
  as demonstrated by a universal multicollision attack against a variant of the MurmurHash2
  algorithm, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4815.
