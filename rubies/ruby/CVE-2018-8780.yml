title: 'CVE-2018-8780 ruby: Unintentional directory traversal by poisoned NULL byte
  in Dir'
date: "2018-03-28"
description: In Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x
  before 2.5.1, and 2.6.0-preview1, the Dir.open, Dir.new, Dir.entries and Dir.empty?
  methods do not check NULL characters. When using the corresponding method, unintentional
  directory traversal may be performed. It was found that the methods from the Dir
  class did not properly handle strings containing the NULL byte. An attacker, able
  to inject NULL bytes in a path, could possibly trigger an unspecified behavior of
  the ruby script.
patched_versions:
- ~> 2.2.10
- ~> 2.3.7
- ~> 2.4.4
- ~> 2.5.1
- '> 2.6.0-preview1'
