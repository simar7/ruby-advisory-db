title: 'CVE-2020-10933 ruby: BasicSocket#read_nonblock method leads to information
  disclosure'
date: "2020-03-31"
description: 'An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5,
  and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception:
  false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is
  copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may
  expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.'
