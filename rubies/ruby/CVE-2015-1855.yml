title: 'CVE-2015-1855 ruby: OpenSSL extension hostname matching implementation violates
  RFC 6125'
date: "2015-04-13"
description: verify_certificate_identity in the OpenSSL extension in Ruby before 2.0.0
  patchlevel 645, 2.1.x before 2.1.6, and 2.2.x before 2.2.2 does not properly validate
  hostnames, which allows remote attackers to spoof servers via vectors related to
  (1) multiple wildcards, (1) wildcards in IDNA names, (3) case sensitivity, and (4)
  non-ASCII characters. It was discovered that the Ruby OpenSSL extension was overly
  permissive when verifying host names against X.509 certificate names with wildcards.
  This could cause Ruby TLS/SSL clients to accept certain certificates as valid, which
  is a violation of the RFC 6125 recommendations.
patched_versions:
- ~> 2.0.0.645
- ~> 2.1.6
- '>= 2.2.2'
